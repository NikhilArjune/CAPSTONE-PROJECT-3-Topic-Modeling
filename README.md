# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-4-Topic-Modeling  on BBC News Articles
In this project your task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. You can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc

Conducted EDA and applied text preprocessing techniques, including BoW , Count
Vectorization , and TF-IDF.

Employed LDA on preprocessed text data and evaluated models based on coherence
score, log likelihood, and perplexity , leveraging essential NLP methodologies .

The LDA model with Count Vectorization demonstrated superior performance,
accurately identifying 5 topics , with the highest log likelihood score (-907800.63) and
the lowest perplexity score (4053.45).
